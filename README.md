# GeoPlay 🎨📐

**GeoPlay** is an interactive, educational web platform designed to teach fundamental geometry concepts to children through visual exploration and motion. This project is a specialized demonstration of **CSS-only** technical skills, showcasing how complex animations, 3D structures, and interactive logic can be built entirely without JavaScript, images, or SVGs.

## 🌟 Key Technical Features

* **Asset-Free Architecture**: The entire project is built using only HTML and CSS. All geometric shapes, icons, and illustrations are rendered using CSS properties like `clip-path`, `conic-gradient`, and `border-radius`.
* **CSS 3D Rendering**: The `3dshapes.html` module utilizes `transform-style: preserve-3d` and `perspective` to create rotatable 3D cubes, pyramids, and prisms.
* **Logic Without JavaScript**: Interactive "Reveal Answer" challenges and hover-triggered animations use CSS pseudo-classes (like `:target` and `:hover`) to manage state and user interaction.
* **Sophisticated Design System**: A unified UI is maintained through a robust set of CSS Variables for colors, spacing, typography, and timing, ensuring a professional and accessible experience.
* **Mathematical Layouts**: Features a functional coordinate plane and symmetry demos built using `repeating-linear-gradient` and precise CSS Grid positioning.

## 🧱 Educational Modules

* **Shapes Playground**: Learn the properties of basic 2D shapes.
* **3D Education**: Explore depth with animated 3D models.
* **Transformations**: Visualize how shapes rotate, scale, skew, and flip.
* **Coordinate Geometry**: Locate points on a 4-quadrant grid system.
* **Area & Perimeter**: Understand formulas through visual diagrams.
* **Symmetry & Patterns**: Discover mirror symmetry and tessellations.
* **Angles & Polygons**: Explore different types of angles and multi-sided shapes like hexagons and octagons.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5**: Semantic markup including `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<article>`.
* **CSS3**:
    * **Flexbox & Grid**: For responsive, adaptive layouts.
    * **Keyframe Animations**: For fluid, "living" geometric motion.
    * **Custom Variables**: For a scalable design system.
    * **3D Transforms**: For rendering three-dimensional depth.
